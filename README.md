# 🇳 🚀 😊  Next.js - Apollo GraphQL - Joy UI

Spend more time __building__ instead of _configuring_ your next project.

## 🚪 Intro

This is a slightly opinionated starter kit for developing [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) apps. It uses the [Joy UI](https://mui.com/joy-ui/getting-started/overview/) library from [MUI](https://mui.com/) along with the [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) stack. All [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) are operations are fully typed with [GraphQL Codegen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) and [Zeus](https://github.com/graphql-editor/graphql-zeus). The starter kit also includes a fully functional [authentication](https://next-auth.js.org/) system, [localization](https://www.i18next.com/), and outputs a [progressive web app](https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa), plus plenty of other goodies for a great developer experience right out of the box.

## 🏃‍ Get started

To get started clone the repo. Using `npx degit` is a great way to get this done quickly as it will remove the `.git` folder plus extra files like the `LICENSE.md` or this very `README.md` file.

```console
npx degit TimMikeladze/next-apollo-joy-starter my-app

cd my-app && git init

yarn && yarn dev
```

Once cloned just install all dependencies with `yarn` and you are ready to go. Happy coding!


> ❗ Important note: This project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for managing dependencies. If you want to use another package manager, remove the `yarn.lock` and control-f for usages of `yarn` in the project and replace them with your package manager of choice.

## 🎓 Usage

### 👷‍ Developing

Start the Next.js development server and watch GraphQL files for code generation.

```console
yarn dev
```

Need to test your GraphQL queries or explore your schema? Use Apollo Sandbox by visiting http://localhost:3000/api/graphql in your browser.

Working on the UI? Start Storybook to develop components in isolation.

```console
yarn storybook
```

### 🔬 Testing

Run tests when changes are detected.

```console
yarn test:watch
```

Or simply run all the tests

```console
yarn test
```

### 📒 Committing

When you are ready to commit simply run the following command to get a well formatted commit message. All staged files will automatically be linted and fixed as well.

```console
yarn commit
```

### ✅ Releasing & tagging

Create a semantic version tag and publish to Github Releases. As part of this process a git tag will also be created on the current branch.

Learn more about how to use the `release-it` command [here](https://github.com/release-it/release-it).

```console
yarn release
```

### 🚧 Building & deploying

This project can be deployed anywhere where Next.js can run. I suggest using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) with the GitHub integration to quickly deploy an app to production.

If you want to build your app for production on your local machine, within a container, etc, simply run the following command:

```console
yarn build
```

### 🔎 Analyzing bundle size

To analyze the page bundles of your Next.js app, run the following command:

```console
yarn build:analyze
```

### 📱 Progressive Web App

This project is configured to be a PWA out of the box, it just needs a few more steps from you to be production ready. Add your image assets and define your manifest files. Start by following the [instructions here](https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa#step-2-add-manifest-file-example).

### ⚙️ Customizing this starter

This project is designed to be a starting point for your project. Each of its features has a small footprint and can be easily removed or replaced with your own.

For example you easily replace Joy UI with Tailwind CSS with minimal effort while keeping the rest of the starter-kit intact.
